# Portfolio



## Personal Portfolio Webpage

I prepared a portfolio page that I can easily add future projects to. I used place holder links that I can change to future webpages and applications that I have created.

## Combining HTML and CSS 

I recently learned how to combine HTML, CSS and media queries to make a reponsive webpage. I used comments in both my HTML and CSS code so it is easy to read and edit in the future. I used place holder links for my future projects. I also added media queries for small screens such as an IPhone. I look forward to using my newly learned skills in HTML/CSS/MediaQueries to create new webapages and applications that I can add to my portfolio.
